**Description:**

Snake is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a snake that grows in length by eating objects on the screen. The goal is to avoid crashing into walls and the snake's body while collecting as many objects as possible to get the highest score. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging and faster.


**Game controls:**

The snake can move all over the playing field, up, down, to the right or to the left.
